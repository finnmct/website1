		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p> I was born in NYU Hospital in Manhattan and lived there for about 5 years. My family then moved to Summit, New Jersey where I went to elementary school, middle school and high school. I have two brothers, Eamon (18) and Owen (16), and a sister, Maeve (12). In high school, I played lacrosse and now continue to do so at Tufts University. In the summertime, I work at a sleepaway camp called Camp Becket, where I attended as a kid.</p>
